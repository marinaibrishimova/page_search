You can optionally move p4g3_srch_app & p4g3_srch_sys above the web root for bonus security but then you'll need to change the path to these 2 folders in public/index.php \r\n\r\nNote: This works well for pages with a small number of posts and it does not break for pages with tons of posts but since it only searches for a match within a particular timeframe, the user is required to keep pressing the Older Posts button until it either finds a match or it doesn't, in which case it will say so.   \r\n\r\nAlso note: Currently there's no fancy \"Did you mean\" spellchecker but that could easily be modified by slapping a levenshtein() while searching recursively. \r\n\r\nThe key controllers are: \r\n\r\np4g3_srch_app/controllers/welcome.php   ---  canvas - default landing page\r\n\r\np4g3_srch_app/controllers/tab.php       ---  tab - everything that goes after installing app to page\r\n\r\nKey models:\r\n\r\nthis app doesn't talk to a database so no need for models, ye\r\n\r\nKey view files:\r\n\r\np4g3_srch_app/views/welcome.php \t--- landing canvas view\r\np4g3_srch_app/views/create.php \t\t--- landing tab view\r\n\r\nKey helper:\r\n\r\np4g3_srch_app/helpers/facebook_helper.php --- where all search functions are at\r\n\r\nDEMO:\r\n[canvas app demo](https://apps.facebook.com/post-finder)\r\n[page tab demo](https://www.facebook.com/ibrius/app_384295561652134)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
